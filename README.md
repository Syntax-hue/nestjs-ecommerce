## Description

This is a ecommerce project with role-based authentication;
The tech stack is: MongoDb + mongoose, React hooks/Redux in Front end;
TypeScript everywhere.

You can also find .env file in the root folder, I keep it in Github to ease the start of the project. The less starting configuration the better. In order to create & use your own database access the folowing [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKyag6t98g8). Make sure you changed MONGO_URI then.

The application is still in developing, I'll add link to React project for frontend down bellow.

```bash
$ npm install
